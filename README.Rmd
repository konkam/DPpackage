# DPpackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A fork from Alejandro Jara's DPpackage, which is currently suspended on CRAN. All credits go to him, the link to the original page is: http://www.mat.uc.cl/~ajara/Softwares.html

## Installation

You may install DPpackage using the github installer provided in the package `devtools` via:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("konkam/DPpackage")
```

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(DPpackage) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
